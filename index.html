  “It’s true that it’s an existential problem: the families don’t even have enough to eat. When they ask, “How are we going to find a solution? Tell us!” the temptation is to say, “OK, here’s 1,000 francs”. What happens after that? Often I try to get them to look at things differently: “You have potential, you are the one who can get yourself out of the predicament you find yourself in. Poverty isn’t a curse; it’s a situation that can arise in anybody’s life. One day you’re rich, the next you’re poor.”

  Being in poverty is something no one wants to be in, yet 66% of the world population lives in poverty, by barely making $10 in international currency.  And about 10% is making less than $1.90 a day, which is the  World Bank’s international line for extreme poverty.  And not only that, but it’s been normalized within urban places.  When was the last time you saw someone homeless and thought that they shouldn’t be in that situation, despite not knowing them?</p>

<h3><b><div id="WhyPov">
  WHY IS POVERTY A THING?
</b>
<p>
  There is no single cause of poverty, poverty can strike during an unexpected crisis: divorce, job loss, or a serious health problem. These crises can be particularly affected when the other risk factors such as low education, limited skills training, lack of savings, or lack of family support can drive someone into poverty. Poverty can result from personal struggle – physical, mental, or emotional – and many people experiencing poverty are faced with a lack of emotional, psychological, or financial support. Poverty also exists because of bigger systems: changing market demand for skills or labor, gaps in social safety nets, the high costs of education and health, or because of systemic discrimination. Poverty exists for all these interlocking reasons and is compounded by the interaction of causes and effects.

<h3><b><div id = "WhatPov">
  WHAT IS POVERTY?
</b></h3><ul>
<p>Poverty is having the lack of resources to survive, this may be impacted by environmental struggles, lack of money, country crises, and many more. Poverty can impact people of all ages and all races. Poverty can leave a child unable to grow, causing their babies to most likely struggle from poverty as well. There are different types of poverty: absolute poverty, relative poverty, and multidimensional poverty.</p>
</ul><ul><p>
	Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country. However, people survived absolute poverty despite only making $1.90 a day or less. And money isn’t the only problem people in absolute poverty struggle with. With children unable to go to school and have to work to provide their families, they lack the knowledge and opportunities to lift themselves out. Absolute poverty means survival needs are not given, rather you have to seek them out yourself. Clean water from the faucet? A stable roof over your head? Knowing you will eat good and nutritious dinners every day? No, with absolute poverty, all those things seem impossible.</p>
</ul><ul>

  <p>
Relative poverty refers to a household income that falls below the median income. In relative poverty, you lack the minimum income needed to maintain your society’s average standard of living. Although relative poverty is not as bad as absolute poverty, it still affects 46.2 million Americans. And 22% of the population under 18 live in this condition.</p>
</ul>

<ul><p>
  Multidimensional poverty is poverty that isn’t because of income. For example, sometimes a person’s income is above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, etc. There are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty: nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person has 3 or more of these key indicators, then he or she is in multidimensional poverty.

  STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLED WITH POVERTY
</b></h3>
 <ul><p>
 Necessity forces you to get out of the house when you have no other choice. I would like to wake up every morning and go to a regular workplace. Before I used to work and I enjoyed that lifestyle of security and a regular income every month.

It allowed me to have a more comfortable lifestyle, to eat out with my wife, do the shopping, etc, but now with the recession, it's harder to find work. I can claim a benefit but can't manage to live on it. I have to go out of the house to find enough money for food, or things for the house. Collecting scrap metal provides work for a lot of people nowadays.

I use my bike as I live quite far from everything and there is no rubbish dump in my village. If I go with a cart it is very slow. With the bike, I manage to do more and to get home to spend time with my children. This lifestyle is very hard, as some days I can find enough to allow us to buy things for the house, milk or meat, etc, but other days, I earn 3 Euros, and have no money to take home. It's hard physical work and tiring, working with the metal, but I put up with it. It's difficult to live like this, with little means, and not harming anyone.

Some days it's so desperate that you don't feel like living anymore. Because you're really in a desperate situation and you don't find anything. Some people insult you and who antagonize you, it makes it more difficult and makes life harder.

When people insult me I try not to reply, to not turn around. I continue on my way. It's a waste of time replying. One day I was on my bike and a person blocked my way with their car. If I was physically attacked, how would I manage to feed my children? Sometimes it's the other way around. Once I had cut my hand and a man stopped and gave me a tissue and looked after the wound. It's a glimmer of hope when people who don't know you understand and approach you and help you, but not financially.

That motivates me and makes the day a better one. When I come home after a day where I didn't earn anything, it is very hard. Nothing is certain. You have to go at the right time when people are throwing something out for you to find. It is a matter of luck. We need more opportunities for everyone. I don't know how to read but I have other qualities which the companies I've worked for have appreciated.

I have been in charge of a mental health center for four years and such I would like to let you know about Mrs. Juana.

Some of the Fourth World Movement volunteers in Peru already knew her and her son Miguel when they used to spend the night on the streets in the Marischal neighborhood. The local children still remember that Miguel used to collect paper and pencils. They recall how he loved to draw and write during his free time just like other children, although two of his fingers were missing.

After many years of homelessness, Mrs. Juana was able to be admitted into our center. Miguel, who then was 11 years old, managed to find employment as a caretaker. This job allowed him to have a roof over his head. To earn money for food, he washed cars. “My son Miguel always remained with me. He washed cars and I watched him washing cars. Afterward, we would sell cheese sandwiches and we ate the unsold ones so that there was no waste."

Due to several setbacks in her small street business, Mrs. Juana lost her main means of survival. She had to resort to begging. “When I want to go street vending, I have to put on old clothes so at least people buy something out of pity for me.” She longs to secure a living for herself and her son.

I was helped to understand Mrs. Juana's situation when I read Fr. Joseph's writing especially in “The Poor are the Church”, which is a book I read and discussed in depth with friends of the Peruvian association ATD Fourth World. This book has always been and will remain a major resource. Father Joseph leads us on the way towards the poorest families of our community. He represents the most important hope for the poorest.

Nowadays, Mrs. Juana is showing me the way. “When I was working,” she told me, “I did not know where to leave my daughter Rosita to have her looked after. A friend of mine recommended home for children where her own stayed. So I decided to let Rosita stay there too. I went to the home and asked the Mother Superior whether Rosita needed money or something. She answered, 'No, she only needs identity papers.' I was sad to have to leave her there. She entered the home when was only 6 years old. I used to go and visit her every day. I used to bring her fruit and other food. The Superior told me, 'You should not come every day so that the girl gets used to the place. Visits are only allowed on Sundays.' So she forbade me to visit during the week.

I told her that I loved bringing Rosita fruit and all kind of things... After that, I used to visit Rosita every Sunday and brought her the food that she enjoyed the most such as chicken broth which I used to prepare especially for her. She loved roast chicken too and chocolate sweets. I used to bring her all of this. Nowadays, she must be missing me; what would she say? She would probably think that I gave her up all of a sudden. How else could she explain that I do not come and visit her any longer? A year has gone by now since I last saw her. I heard that she has been moved to another home but nobody knows which one. I recently went to the magisterial office and inquired. I was told, 'We do not have her file.' So I asked them when I could come back to have an answer. They told me at the end of the week. I met my son Miguel when I was out the other day. He asked me about his sister, ' You must know where my sister is,' he said, 'so that I can go and visit her."

In the mental health center, we often welcome people who have been picked up on the streets and brought in to us by the police. They all seem to be cut off from their family and excluded. They could remain like this forever if we were not convinced that they are worthwhile and that their daily efforts in fighting extreme poverty are also ways to build and keep social relationships. Referring to Father Joseph's life and thinking and using the personal experience of people like Mrs. Juana, we can truly learn from the life of the very poor. Thus we discover and better understand their hopes, but also their longing for support and brotherhood which we are compelled to give them.

My name is Méra. I come from the island of Anjouan, in the Comoro Islands. I have a wife and three children. I arrived in Mayotte in 1994 when I was 20 years old. I came to Mayotte to find a better life. I have not yet found it, but I remain hopeful.

As I don’t have a work permit, I can’t find a real job. I do a little here and there because I know a lot of people. I like sitting doing nothing on my own, so I go to talk to people – anyone – no matter where they’re from. Since I know lots of people, I know that so-and-so knows how to make panels from plaited coconut fiber, and I can put them together. I don’t hide my situation; I tell people and they can then think of me when there is an odd job to do.

The other Comoriens ask me how I know so many people. I tell them that you need to talk. I go to the mosque every day and I ask God to show me the right path.

I live in a Banga, a one-roomed house made out of corrugated iron, which I built on a piece of land which was lent to me. Although when it rains a lot, the path is difficult as there is lots of mud.

I buy bundles of second-hand clothes to sell in the neighborhood. I sell to people who can’t go to the market. Yet it is difficult because they often don’t pay me. If I see someone with torn clothes, I prefer to give them some clothes even if they don’t ask for any. I give them in secret as it’s not good to give them out in the middle of people, as others don’t see it in a good way. They want you to give them the same thing or for the person who received something to give it away, even if they have less need.

Religion says ‘if you give a little, you will receive a lot’. If I find something to eat, I share it as it’s not good to eat on your own. If I find bananas in the countryside, I give them out. For me, it’s important to say hello and to laugh with people.
